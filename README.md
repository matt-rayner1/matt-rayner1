Hi, I'm Matt.
I'm interested in cyber-security, scripting and software engineering.

I'm currently doing a software engineering bootcamp.

I have previously learned the CompTIA Network+, Security+ and PenTest+ modules, as well as trying out TryHackMe.
I started coding with C, and then went on to python soon after.
